# Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Visualizer

An interactive web-based tool to visualize **Minimum Spanning Trees (MST)** using **Prim's** and **Kruskal's** algorithms. Built with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap**, this project allows users to create graphs, add edges, and see how MST algorithms work dynamically.

## Features
- **Graph Creation**: Add nodes and edges interactively.
- **Algorithm Selection**: Run **Prim's** or **Kruskal's** algorithm.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Watch the MST form step by step.
- **Total Cost Calculation**: Displays the minimum cost of the spanning tree.
- **Background Animation**: Smooth and aesthetic background effects.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the web application.
- **CSS**: Styling for a modern UI.
- **JavaScript**: Core logic for graph creation and MST algorithms.
- **Bootstrap**: Responsive design and UI components.

## How to Use
1. **Add Nodes**: Click to place nodes on the canvas.
2. **Add Edges**: Select two nodes to create an edge with a randomly assigned weight.
3. **Run MST Algorithms**:
   - **Prim's Algorithm**: Select a starting node and visualize its MST formation.
   - **Kruskal's Algorithm**: Find the MST using a greedy edge selection approach.
4. **Clear Graph**: Reset everything and start fresh.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mst-visualizer.git
